Getting back into the swing of things.

New comment: I still don't know how to use command line arguments efficiently. ; ;


So, today, I watched a really interesting video about a world world II veteran and I actually learned something. I found it particulary interesting because of this singular quote that Richard Overtan said, "I may give out, but I'll never give up." It's a beautiful and encouraging thing to say, albeit an incredibly hard one to executed. This saying really inspired to at least try and do my homework for my computer graphics class. Because honestly, I'm so scared that I may not be good enough or that I may not have what it takes to get through this course, but the least that I can do is try. And so here I am.
